Firstly, please find my code as gd9319_assignment2.cpp

1.Extract the complete Debug folder above in the zip folder named  CSC5870_gd9319_Assignment2
2.Change the pleasegraphics.hw2 to pleasegraphics.exe
3.Run the .exe file( Run in the same folder where all the dlls and other files are present)    



(could not exactly finish the texture part as desired as I was getting linker issues when using image loading libraries. I tried with various in visual studio like SOIL, DEViL , etc.. but could not successfully after all my efforts).
